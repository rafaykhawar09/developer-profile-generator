# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Developer Profile Generator

I successfully created a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their github username and a color to choose from a list of colors, which then be used as the background color for cards.

The PDF will be populated with the following:

* Profile image
* User name
* Links to the following:
  * User location via Google Maps
  * User GitHub profile
  * User blog
* User bio
* Number of public repositories
* Number of followers
* Number of GitHub stars
* Number of users following
